#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### Build words from letters.  
####   
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can edit its title and description. Once that file is added, I’ll also create a new file `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` for the app logo.

A stylized logo featuring a stylized letter "W" composed of interlocking puzzle pieces, each piece shaped like a letter from the alphabet. The background is a vibrant gradient from teal to purple, giving the logo a modern, energetic feel. The puzzle pieces are arranged to form the shape of a word, symbolizing the app's purpose of building words from letters. The overall design is bold and eye-catching, suitable for a web app icon.
